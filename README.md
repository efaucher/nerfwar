# NERF War Rules

## Honor Rules
### Cheating
This rule should go without saying, but it bears repeating: no cheating! Cheating ruins the fun and sport of the game for every player, so don’t cheat. It sounds cheesy, but you’re only cheating yourself out of a fun experience. You also run the risk of getting caught and won’t be invited back for another game.

### Arguing
No arguing. Arguing about whether you were hit brings the game to stop and ruins the flow and fun for everyone. You came to take part in a Nerf war, not join a debate club. If someone is lying about having hit you, they’ll get theirs in the end.

## Safety Rules

1. No intentional face shots. Always wear eye protection during battle. If you don't wear any eye protection, you are out of the game.
1. Do not shoot at people that don't wear any eye protection. 
1. No physical contact with other players. No pushing or hitting. No wrestling weapons away from people.
1. In tight space: avoid running.

## General Rules

1. Participants can use NERF or equivalent blasters only. No water guns or other weapon types. The game permits modified blasters, but none using CO2.
1. When a referee calls a timeout: stop firing immediately.
1. Do not throw or drop blasters. They break easily.
1. Do not deliberately throw or shoot anything that outside the boundaries.
1. You can loot participants that have been hit out of the game, but you cannot loot custom blasters. After the battle is over, you must return all blasters. 

## Combat Rules

1. Do not start the battle until the referee calls the start of the battle.
1. Listen for the end-of-battle call and report to the assembly area.
1. If you have been hit, raise your hand to indicate clearly that you have been hit.
1. If you have been hit out of the game, remove yourself from the battle area so other players do not get confused and think you are still in the game.
1. There is no friendly fire. Shooting allies on purpose or accidentally does not count as a hit.

# Team Elimination
**Goal:** Eliminate opposing players by scoring hits on them until they run out of hits and are 'out'. Your team wins when all opposing teams are completely eliminated.

Every player has 3 hits before they are 'out'. When you are hit, you must count out loud slowly to 15 while pointing your blaster up in the air. After you count to 15, shout "Clear!" to let everyone know you are back in play, and resume playing. When you are hit for the third time, you are out of the game completely. When you are hit and counting back in, you are allowed to pick up ammo and walk around as long as you stay out of the way and make it clear that you are counting in. When you clear in, you have to clear in with out of range of the opposing team, with the rest of your team. You can't clear in behind your opponents and surprise them, and you can't clear in close enough to shoot them right after clearing.

# Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT)
**Goal:** Eliminate all traitors and survive as an innocent. For traitors: Eliminate all innocents.

Every player will receive secretly a card, revealing a role. You can be either an *innocent*, a *traitor* or the *detective*. All roles are kept secret (exception with the detective ability)

At the start of each round, all players must close their eyes and reach out with their arms in front of them. The detective will ask the traitors to raise their thumb and open their eyes, to identify the other traitors. The detective ask them afterward to close their eyes and lower their thumbs. After a minute while everyone moves in the play area, the game starts. Rounds are 5 minutes long. The detective is considered as an innocent and is known to everyone at the start of the round.

If any innocents are alive at the end of the 5 minutes, the innocents wins.
If all traitors are dead, the innocents wins.
If innocents are dead, traitors wins.

**Innocent:** You are considered "the good guys". Try to work with the players to rat out and tag out the traitors of the round.
**Traitor:** You are considered "the bad guys". Try to work with the other traitors (or not!) and tag out all the innocents.
**Detective:** You are considered "the police". You have a special ability: you can ask any player tagged out what were their role in the round (traitor or innocent). You are also considered as an innocent.
